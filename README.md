## Instructions: 

-> Download the files, compile, and run the Server.java Class then Login.java to start the program. Do not run the QuizMenu.java file.

## User Class:

This allows you to create a user with a username and password and role. Used in LoggingIn Feature whenever you read the UserDetails.txt file. When the LoggingIn Class reads the UserDetails.txt file, it creates the user object and then edits from it. Tested with a main method and tested whenever I use the LoggingIn class.

## Class Class:

This groups the Courses into one single place to allow for accessors and mutators to get to them. Essentially itâ€™s a complicated version of a static ArrayList. Tested with a sample main method and whenever I use a class that uses the class object.

## CourseInfoHandler:

This reads the info from CourseDetailstxt and creates courses based on it. Very helpful because it allows a way to get at all the information about courses from the beginning of the program. Tested with a sample Main method and whever it's referenced in another class.

## LoggingIn:

This is essentially all the methods to help with the logging in feature. It does stuff like check if the user exists, edits the username, edits the password, creates User, deletes account, and checks redundancy. Rishab added a readUserInfo Class to help with whenever we need an array list of the user objects. Tested with a sample main method and whenever it's referenced in another class.

## Question:

This is an object to hold questions and their information in. The Question class includes several methods that allow users to interact with question objects however they please. For instance, it allows teachers to edit specific question attributes like point value and to randomize answer choices if desired. Question was tested with a sample main method and whenever it's referenced in another class.
          
## Quiz:

This is an object that holds questions with a quiz name. The Quiz class includes several methods that allow users to interact with quizzes in a variety of ways. The Constructors let teachers create quizzes manually or by entering a quiz file. The methods provide the functionality to edit quizzes, calculate the max score of quizzes, randomize the order of quiz questions, create submission strings for both teachers and students to view individual quiz results, and to access the submissions for a specific student. There is also an equals method to help teachers delete quizzes and a toString method to print quiz details. Quiz was tested with a sample main method and whenever it's referenced in another class.
          
## Course:

This is an class that creates an object that holds the information about a course, specifically the course name and the quizzes within the course. This was tested with a main method and whenever it's referenced in another class.

## QuizMenu:

Contains the old methods from the previous terminal version of the code

## Submission:

This is a class that is an object of different submissions. It holds the name of the User who submits,  the Quiz being taken, Course of the quiz, response list, timestamp, boolean if it's graded, and a list of grades. This has been tested with a test class and further tested with the test method.

## Server:

Server side of the code and returns the information requested by the user. Handles the communication and sending information to the Login class. Allows concurrency and multi-threading.

## Login:

Contains the new GUI menu for student and user. Handles all the functionality in the code and replaces the old QuizMenu. Allows the user to login as student or teacher and depending on that displays two different menus. For teacher, the menu has the functionality to edit and create quizes and courses. Also they have a common future with the student, which is the edit account option where they can change username and password or delete an account. On student side, they get to edit their account, take quiz and view submissions. The take quiz option allows the student to pick course and a quiz they want to take. The view submission views all of the submissions for a specific quiz made by the user that is logged in.
